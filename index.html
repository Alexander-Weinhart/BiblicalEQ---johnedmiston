				<p><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i><br>Biblical EQ is an exceptionally clear description of Biblical principles and the dynamics of their operation in human life. The clarity of the writing and the grasp of Biblical truth is well above other books in this field. It is hard to think of a book of this modest size as being exhaustive, but it is.</p><i class="fa-solid quotert fa-quote-right"></i>
