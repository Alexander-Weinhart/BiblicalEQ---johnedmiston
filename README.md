Completely redesign https://biblicaleq.com
It should become:

1. Responsive
2. Attractive
3. Fast-loading
4. Well written with a clear message. You can use either British spelling or USA spelling.
5. Images should be Creative Commons, please do not use any images that might be copyright protected.
6. Please do NOT use Wordpress, please code it in html, css, javascript etc. Use Dreamweaver or similar coding tools.
7. Try to SEO optimize head tags and the text on the web page with key-words such as grace, Christian, books, etc

I have invited you to a Github repository: https://github.com/johnedmiston/BiblicalEQ/

This is where you will store the code. If you need a test server we can arrange that as well, once you need it.
